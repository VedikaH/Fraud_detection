Fraud Detection Model
Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict fraudulent financial transactions. The dataset used contains 6,362,620 rows and 10 columns. The primary goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent and provide insights into the key factors that influence fraudulent behavior. This project follows the typical stages of data cleaning, model development, evaluation, and interpretation.

Business Context
The purpose of this project is to proactively detect fraudulent transactions for a financial company and to use the insights gained from the model to develop actionable prevention strategies. The model is trained to identify potentially fraudulent transactions, which typically involve transferring funds to another account and then cashing out.


Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values and outliers.
Addressed multi-collinearity between features.
Feature Engineering:

Created new features and selected relevant variables based on their importance in predicting fraud.
Handling Class Imbalance:

Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset.
Model Development
The following models were developed and evaluated:

Random Forest:

Provided an easy way to interpret feature importance, crucial for fraud detection.
Precision, Recall, F1-Score were high, indicating a strong model.
XGBoost:

Also performed well, particularly in maximizing recall.
Fine-tuning was performed to improve performance.
Model Evaluation
AUC-ROC Score: The model achieved an AUC-ROC score of 0.9989, indicating excellent performance in distinguishing between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
Precision-Recall: The threshold was adjusted to 0.8, which balanced precision and recall effectively.
Key Insights
Feature Importance:
The most important features identified by the Random Forest model include the transaction amount, the difference between the old and new balances, and the type of transaction.
These features make logical sense in the context of fraud detection, where large or unusual transactions are more likely to be fraudulent.
Preventative Measures
To prevent fraud, the following actions are recommended:

Monitoring Large Transactions: Implement stricter monitoring and flagging for large transactions, especially those exceeding 200,000.
Enhanced Authentication: Strengthen authentication measures for transactions involving significant amounts of money or unusual activity.
Real-Time Analysis: Deploy real-time analytics to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions as they occur.
Performance Monitoring
To determine if the implemented measures are effective, continuous performance monitoring of the model is necessary. Key performance indicators (KPIs) include:

Reduction in Fraudulent Transactions: Track the number of fraudulent transactions detected over time.
False Positive Rate: Monitor the rate of transactions incorrectly classified as fraudulent.
Model Drift: Regularly retrain the model with new data to account for changes in fraud patterns.
